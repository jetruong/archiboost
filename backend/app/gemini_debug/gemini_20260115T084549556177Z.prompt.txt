You are analyzing an annotated overlay image comparing two versions of the SAME architectural drawing. The image shows:
- RED linework = Drawing A (the original/reference version)
- CYAN linework = Drawing B (the revised/comparison version)
- Where linework overlaps perfectly, it appears darker (both versions match)
- Yellow highlighted areas indicate detected differences between the versions
- Red bounding boxes labeled R1, R2, etc. mark specific difference regions
- The region IDs correspond to the list below

Detected difference regions:
- Region 1: located at bbox (1649, 245, 65x70), area=1725 pixels
- Region 2: located at bbox (649, 72, 50x20), area=824 pixels

Please provide a concise summary of the differences (2-4 sentences). For each significant region:
1. Reference the region label (e.g., "Region 1", "Region 2")
2. Describe the drawing/content change (do not describe color/pixels moving between colors):
   - Present only in Drawing A (RED-only) = removed in the revision
   - Present only in Drawing B (CYAN-only) = added in the revision
   - Both present but offset = alignment shift or a moved/adjusted element (state uncertainty)
   - IMPORTANT: Text/dimensions often shift slightly and may appear as RED-only in one spot and CYAN-only in a nearby spot. If you can find the same/similar text or symbol in the other color nearby, describe it as "moved/repositioned" rather than "removed/added".
3. Note the general location in the drawing
4. If there is any visible/legible text near the region (notes, callouts, dimensions, revision tags), quote or paraphrase it and use it to explain the change; if the text is not legible, say so.

Important guidelines:
- Be concise and technical
- Never say things like "red pixels moved to cyan" or treat CYAN as a "diff layer"—CYAN is the revised linework.
- Avoid strong add/remove claims for dimension strings/callouts unless you cannot find a corresponding callout of the same content nearby in the other version; when unsure, say it "may have moved" or "may have been updated".
- State uncertainty when the change is unclear (e.g., "appears to be", "may indicate")
- Focus on architectural significance (walls, fixtures, dimensions, annotations)
- If differences seem minor (small areas or line weight variations), mention this
- Do not speculate beyond what's visible in the image
