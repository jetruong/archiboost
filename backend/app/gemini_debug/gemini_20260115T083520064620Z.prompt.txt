You are analyzing an annotated overlay image comparing two architectural drawings. The image shows:
- RED linework = Drawing A (the original/reference drawing)
- CYAN linework = Drawing B (the revised/comparison drawing)  
- Where lines overlap perfectly, they appear darker (both drawings match)
- Yellow highlighted areas indicate detected differences between the drawings
- Red bounding boxes labeled R1, R2, etc. mark specific difference regions
- The region IDs correspond to the list below

Detected difference regions:

Please provide a concise summary of the differences (2-4 sentences). For each significant region:
1. Reference the region label (e.g., "Region 1", "Region 2")
2. Describe what appears to have changed:
   - RED only = content removed in revision (present in A, missing in B)
   - CYAN only = content added in revision (missing in A, present in B)
   - Slight offset of both colors = content moved or adjusted
3. Note the general location in the drawing

Important guidelines:
- Be concise and technical
- State uncertainty when the change is unclear (e.g., "appears to be", "may indicate")
- Focus on architectural significance (walls, fixtures, dimensions, annotations)
- If differences seem minor (small areas or line weight variations), mention this
- Do not speculate beyond what's visible in the image

Begin your response directly with the summary, no introductory phrases.
