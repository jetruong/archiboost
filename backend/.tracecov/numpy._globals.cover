       Module defining global singleton classes.
       
       This module raises a RuntimeError if an attempt to reload it is made. In that
       way the identities of the classes defined here are fixed and will remain so
       even if numpy itself is reloaded. In particular, a function like the following
       will still work correctly after numpy is reloaded::
       
           def foo(arg=np._NoValue):
               if arg is np._NoValue:
                   ...
       
       That was not the case when the singleton classes were defined in the numpy
       ``__init__.py`` file. See gh-7844 for a discussion of the reload problem that
       motivated this module.

           Common reasons for using this keyword are:
       
           - A new keyword is added to a function, and that function forwards its
             inputs to another function or method which can be defined outside of
             NumPy. For example, ``np.std(x)`` calls ``x.std``, so when a ``keepdims``
             keyword was added that could only be forwarded if the user explicitly
             specified ``keepdims``; downstream array libraries may not have added
             the same keyword, so adding ``x.std(..., keepdims=keepdims)``
             unconditionally could have broken previously working code.
           - A keyword is being deprecated, and a deprecation warning must only be
             emitted when the keyword is used.
